      <h2>Why TASA? </h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The Taiwanese-American identity is a vastly varied one and at times a divisive issue. Moreover, there is
        political and cultural apathy among many Taiwanese, and under-representation in our communities. Yet, from those
        who barely identify themselves as Taiwanese, to those who feel passionately about Taiwanese culture, they are
        all still unified under a common background. Those with the Taiwanese-American identity have the potential to
        develop into a tight-knit community and strong leaders with a unified voice in this nation.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The Taiwanese American Student Association at the University of California, Berkeley is dedicated to promoting
        the unity and cooperation of Taiwanese-Americans in the community, the presence of the Taiwanese American
        community in local and national arenas, and the culture and identity of Taiwanese-Americans. TASA will hold
        events bringing together people of all backgrounds and ideals, uniting them by a common culture and interest,
        and together building the awareness of Taiwanese-Americans of their own identity and culture, knowledge in their
        heritage, and strong recognition from others.</p>

      <h2>Families</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        One of TASA's biggest draws is the family system! Families provide an opportunity to get to know other members
        on a more intimate and personal level in smaller and more frequent get-togethers. Some fun family events we've
        had in the past include picnics, water balloon fights, making dumplings, or just getting a bite to eat with your
        family! There's no rules about sticking only to one family, so feel free to attend all of our family events! We
        hope to foster some lifelong friendships through our family system.</p><br>

      <h2>Cabinet</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        We wouldn't be able to do anything at TASA without our lovely cabinet. Officers plan and organize all of the events for our members and work hard to make sure that everyone has a good time. We're a diverse group hailing from all sorts of foreign countries and random states you've never heard about! We're proud to call TASA home and we are more than happy to welcome you to our TASA family. And, for those interested in getting involved, we have an officer internship program just for you.<br><br><br></p>
